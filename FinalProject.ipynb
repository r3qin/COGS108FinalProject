We considered other variables such as gender and type of crime committed but concluded that including them would create a different project in itself.

    "The background of our dataset comes from a crime data census from 2010 to the present as well as crime stats for the region of San Diego. We planned to take a look to see if the time of year circulating around major holidays has a relationship with the crime rates in Los Angeles. There have been studies done in the past that look at the effect of different factors such as religion or seasons on the crime rate. In an article by Matthew Lee, they take a look into the influence of religious institutions on crime in rural areas. In another article by David McDowall about the seasonal cycle of crime, which found that there are in fact patterns and seasonal behaviors for major crime rates. It seems that seasonal behavior is influenced by environmental and social components that may vary based on location. This other research shows the influence of factors that influence crime in areas around the world. The seasonal patterns and the religious influences support the fact that there might be an influence of crime rates around major holidays or religious holidays that are apart of California’s seasonal pattern.\n",

If there are several people having work off during these holidays, we assumed that people who are planning to commit a crime would have an easier time doing so."

    "Our hypothesis was that there would be more crimes committed on major (government mandated) holidays than those on other days. We gathered and studied police reports from the city of Los Angeles from years 2015 to 2018. With our data and analysis we found out that there was no correlation between major holidays and the number of crimes committed. Instead, we found that more crimes were committed on the first day of each month compared to the rest of the days in the month. Some limitations with our project could be that some crime reports were not reported or withheld from the public. Our work on the correlation between crimes and holidays can help society become safe by alerting people to be more careful on some days than others …"
